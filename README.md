# Advent of Zig!

I want to learn Zig, and so I thought the best way to get into the language is to re-solve all
[Advent of Code puzzles from 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I also stream some of my progress on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@zekrodev/streams) and
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zekrotja) *(only in german)*.

> Many thanks to @LordMZTE for helping and explaining a lot during my first twitch stream.
